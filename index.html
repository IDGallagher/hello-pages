            <p>This is a kind of development diary for Lost Communications - and probably various other things. Welcome!</p>
            <p>In it I'll throw in random thoughts and snippets of things.</p>
            <p>We're building a new show: Lost Communications Underwater - based on our underwater explorations. Its going to feature evolving life and have an online world that is incorporated into the live show's visuals. People will be able to experience a show live in person but also online as an avatar. It'll be similar to our previous show - Home X - and based in the same universe - possibly.</p>
            <p>Everything is very new and fluid at the moment. Follow along!</p>
